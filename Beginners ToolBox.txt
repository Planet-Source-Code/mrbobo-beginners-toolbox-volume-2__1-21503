Beginners Toolbox - Volume 2
In response to requests for more samples here is Volume 2. This collection includes the use of scrollbars, listboxes and the treeview.
Move listitems up or down in a listbox, remove duplicates etc. The treeview example demonstrates a fully functioning 'Favorites bar' for
a Web browser application using Internet explorers favorites - add links, add new folders, rename, delete etc. Also included is a KeyCode giver, a picture resizer, and just for fun a random mousemover.
Code for each function appear in a textbox ready to copy into your project. I hope this is of some help to people beginning VB. Good luck.
